Internal and external system validation (T2.4)

As discussed during the last Plenary Meeting at Naples, it is necessary that all Demo Cases define a planification for the validation of their results, methodology and usefulness. This should be done in three steps:

1. During February and March with internal users. For example, in Spain there will be biweekly meetings all DC members to verify the functionality following the defined questionnaire.
2. During April and May semi-internal user validation. That means final users from the consortium partners that are not directly related to the project. In Spain, this would mean that we would organise several workshops with non-Clarity users from Acciona and CEDEX. For other DCs an option might be people from municipalities.
3. During June, on top of assisting to Riga's workshop, the plan would be to hold additional ones with external users.
